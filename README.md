# Supply Train

## Getting started
1. Install required dependencies: `yarn install`
2. ??? 
3. Run server: `yarn start`


## Assumptions
* We did not have data to know how many ventilators each states had but we do know how many ICU beds each states have. We made an assumption that 20-50 percent of ICU beds in each states have access to a ventilators
* We did not know how many cases from each states requires ventilators, thus we made an assumption that 3 to 5 percent of active cases requires ventilators.
